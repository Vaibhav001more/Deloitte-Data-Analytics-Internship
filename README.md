## üìä Project 1: Factory Downtime Analysis (Tableau)

### **Objective**
Analyze machine telemetry data collected from four global factories to identify **downtime trends** and **operational inefficiencies**.

### **Key Highlights**
- Created a **calculated field `Unhealthy`** to represent potential machine breakdown time (**10 minutes per error**).
- Built two **bar charts** in Tableau:
  - **Downtime per Factory**
  - **Downtime per Device Type**
- Designed an **interactive dashboard** with filtering capabilities to drill down by factory.
- Identified the factory and machine types with the **most downtime**.
